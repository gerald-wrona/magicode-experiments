Prompt:

I want you to create a .png flow diagram of my meal preparation process. There will be several phases. Each phase will need a short description which captures the essence of activities completed during that phase. In the first phase I spend time researching recipes and collecting ideas. In the second phase I eliminate any recipes that are too impractical. In the third phase I create a shopping list and purchase ingredients. In the fourth and final phase I cook.

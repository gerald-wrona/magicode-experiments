Prompt:

Retrieve age and median income features from United States census data and create a scatter plot in Python using the seaborn library.


Completion:

To create a scatter plot in Python using the seaborn library, we first need to import the necessary libraries and load the data. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

2. Load the data:

```python
# Assuming the data is in a CSV file named 'census_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv('census_data.csv')
```

3. Retrieve age and median income features:

```python
# Assuming 'Age' and 'Median Income' are the columns in the data
age = data['Age']
income = data['Median Income']
```

4. Create a scatter plot:

```python
# Create a scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x=age, y=income)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Median Income')
plt.title('Age vs Median Income')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

Please note that the actual code might vary depending on the structure of your data and the specific columns you want to use. Also, you need to replace 'census_data.csv' and 'Age' and 'Median Income' with your actual file name and column names.



Observations:
	- Code is instructional in nature
	- Code needs a lot of text editing before you can run it
		- It automatically capitalizes field names
		- It does verbose reassignment
	- It doesn't know your data
	- It's overly verbose

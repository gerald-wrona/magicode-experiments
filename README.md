I experimented with the new Magicoder tool using it for common data science problems.

Credit for Magicoder goes to the research team that produced the original work ("Magicoder: Source Code is All You Need", Wei 2023)
Credit for the gradio implementation is to AK(@_akhaliq) and the Hugging Face team
